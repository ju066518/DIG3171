# Distant Reading Assignment 

For this assignment, I chose to use the wiki page on the Mooshroom mob from the official Minecraft Wiki. I chose this page specifically to put in Voyant and CoPilot because there is specific statistical information on the page (mob stats, block size, loot tables, etc.) that is easily verifiable and able to fact-check once the information has been uploaded to the AIs. I have had experience doing a similar assignment to this with ChatGPT in one of my previous classes, where the information that came back was very inaccurate, so I decided to use something a bit easier to see what the AI’s limits are. Voyant presented reasonably accurate information, but the information it gave that was the easiest to digest was purely about the page’s contents (how many times specific words showed up in the article, etc.) rather than some of the specific information I was looking for in order to fact-check. For example, I was very easily able to learn that the word Mooshroom was used 110 times in the article (upon fact checking on the original page the actual number was 179), but when I attempted to find the loot table included in the article, the translation turned into a giant block of raw data that was incredibly difficult to seam through. CoPilot, on the other hand, almost felt like it was trying to give me as little information as possible. There was an easy to find segment about loot tables, however, there were no numerical values included nor was there a section on how the Looting enchantment affected the item drop rate like there was on the original article. Overall, my experience with these AIs has reaffirmed my initial instincts to go straight to the source of the information rather than taking shortcuts.
